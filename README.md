Welcome to **Analytics Zone**! :)

This repository is a collection of small-scale data analytics projects and experiments.  
Think of it as my personal playground to explore datasets, test methods, and share insights.

## Projects

### 1. Solar Energy Data Analysis
- **Focus:** Exploring the relationship between weather conditions and solar panel electricity output.  
- **Highlights:**

  âœ… Descriptive statistics of irradiance, temperature, humidity, and solar output.

  âœ… Handling missing values and outliers.

  âœ… Correlation analysis and interpretation.
- **Result:** Irradiance has the strongest positive correlation with solar output, while humidity shows a weak negative effect.
