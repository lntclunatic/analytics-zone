# Analytics Zone

Welcome to **Analytics Zone**! :)

This repository is a collection of small-scale data analytics projects and experiments.  
Think of it as my personal playground to explore datasets, test methods, and share insights.

## Projects

### 1. Solar Energy Data Analysis
- **Focus:** Exploring the relationship between weather conditions and solar panel electricity output.  
- **Highlights:**

  âœ… Descriptive statistics of irradiance, temperature, humidity, and solar output.

  âœ… Handling missing values and outliers.

  âœ… Correlation analysis and interpretation.
- **Result:** Irradiance has the strongest positive correlation with solar output, while humidity shows a weak negative effect.

### 2. Solar Energy Regression Analysis
- **Focus:** Building regression models to predict solar panel electricity output.  
- **Methods:**
  
  âœ… Simple Linear Regression (Irradiance â†’ Solar Output) â†’ RÂ² = 0.659 (significant)  
  âœ… Linear Regression (Day Number â†’ Solar Output) â†’ RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.001 (not significant)  
  âœ… Multiple Linear Regression (Irradiance, Temperature, Humidity â†’ Solar Output) â†’ RÂ² = 0.660  
- **Evaluation:**
  
  âœ… MAE  : 0.1421  
  âœ… RMSE : 0.1731  
  âœ… MAPE : 16.43%  
- **Insight:**
  
  âœ… Irradiance is the most significant predictor of solar output.  
  âœ… Day Number has almost no effect.  
  âœ… The multivariate model slightly improves accuracy compared to the simple model.
